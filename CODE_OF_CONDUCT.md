# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

HexaGlue is an open source project built by and for people.
As contributors and maintainers, we affirm that **respect for human dignity, human rights, and individual freedom** is a non-negotiable foundation of our community.

We pledge to foster an environment that is:

* Respectful of all individuals, regardless of background, identity, or beliefs
* Grounded in empathy, reason, and intellectual honesty
* Aligned with the humanist values historically carried by the open source movement

Participation in HexaGlue should be safe, constructive, and enriching — both technically and humanly.

---

## Humanist Values of Open Source

Open source is not only about code. It is about:

* **Freedom**: the freedom to learn, understand, modify, and share knowledge
* **Equality**: equal dignity and respect for all contributors
* **Solidarity**: mutual help, knowledge transmission, and collective progress
* **Responsibility**: the ethical use of technology and language

HexaGlue explicitly embraces these values. Any behavior that contradicts them has no place in this project.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

We encourage all participants to:

* Treat every person with respect, regardless of experience level or opinion
* Use inclusive, clear, and professional language
* Engage in technical disagreement with arguments, not authority or aggression
* Listen actively and assume good faith
* Be mindful of the impact of words, not just their intent
* Help others grow — especially newcomers
* Keep discussions focused on architecture, code, and ideas

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable:

* Any form of harassment, discrimination, or dehumanization
* Racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language or behavior
* Personal attacks, humiliation, or intimidation
* Justifying or trivializing violations of human rights
* Dismissing people based on identity rather than ideas
* Threats, coercion, or incitement to hatred
* Publishing private or sensitive information without explicit consent

No technical contribution justifies violating human dignity.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to **all spaces related to HexaGlue**, including:

* GitHub issues, pull requests, and code reviews
* Discussions, comments, and documentation
* Any private or public communication linked to the project

It applies regardless of role, seniority, or contribution level.

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Maintainers are not only technical stewards — they are **guardians of the community culture**.

They are responsible for:

* Upholding this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly
* Intervening when discussions cross ethical or human boundaries
* Protecting contributors from harassment or exclusion
* Prioritizing the long-term health of the community over short-term productivity
* Acting with transparency, restraint, and respect

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject any contribution that violates this Code of Conduct.

---

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may be reported privately to the project maintainer.

All reports will be:

* Taken seriously
* Reviewed impartially
* Handled with respect for confidentiality whenever possible

Possible actions include:

* A private warning or request for clarification
* Public moderation of content
* Temporary or permanent exclusion from discussions
* Rejection or reversal of contributions
* In severe cases, banning from project spaces

There is no appeal to technical merit against ethical violations.

---

## Engineering Culture

HexaGlue promotes a culture where:

* Strong technical opinions are welcome
* Intellectual rigor is valued
* Disagreement is expected and healthy
* Respect is mandatory

We believe that **excellent software emerges from communities that respect people first**.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the open source and free software movements, the Contributor Covenant, and broader humanist principles, adapted to HexaGlue’s focus on professional software engineering and architecture.
